# SAP Open Source Manifesto

## About this project

This Manifesto states SAP's open source principles about how we engage with open source. The manifesto aligns with SAP's established presence as a key contributor to open source, highlighting its top 10 ranking in the Open-Source-Contributor-Index active role in pivotal projects that influence digital innovation, like OpenUI5, and OpenJDK. The Manifesto talks about SAP's commitments to open source, about our vision, about our external engagement with open source, and how we empower our employees to collaborate with open source. It is a clear statement providing guidance to our internal developers, but also customers, partners, and developer ecosystem.

## Introduction

At SAP, we've always believed in the power of collaborative innovation. From the early days of our enterprise standard software based on a source-available license to today's cloud-native open-source projects initiated by SAP, our goal has been to empower organizations and employees to achieve more.
The open-source movement complements this mission perfectly, fostering an environment of shared ideas, code, and aspirations. Our engagement with open source is not new; it's a continuation of our commitment to openness, collaboration, and development efficiency. This manifesto articulates our dedication, commitment, and aspirations regarding open source.
